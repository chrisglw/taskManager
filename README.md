# Overview

The software I created is a Task Manager application. This application allows users to manage and organize tasks by providing functionality to add, delete, and list tasks based on their priority. Each task consists of a name, description, and priority, which can be set as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.

The purpose of developing this software was to gain practical experience in Kotlin and deepen my understanding of the language's syntax and features.

For a detailed demonstration of the software in action and a walkthrough of the code, please watch the [Software Demo Video](http://youtube.link.goes.here).

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA as my integrated development environment (IDE) for Kotlin programming.

The software was written in the Kotlin programming language.

# Useful Websites

Several online resources were valuable in the process of developing this software. Here are some websites that provided useful information and guidance:
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

# Future Work

- **Storing data:** Adding the capability to save and load tasks to and from a file or database for data persistence.
- **Task editing:** Allowing users to edit task details after creation.
- **GUI implementation:** Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
